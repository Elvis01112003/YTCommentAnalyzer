@belarustomma,"Jeez, this video just unbelievable! Many new words, especially I remember one of the best word in the planet in my humble opinion, this is derogatory) After example on movie about Rocky, also is my one of favorite movie, I remember this word long time) I wanna would in next video about MMA FIGHTER INTERVIEW) For example may analytics Sean Strickland, Khabib Nurmagomedov or Israel Adesanya, I guess fighters pronunciation help more people learn English faster) Thanks a lot for another great lesson"
